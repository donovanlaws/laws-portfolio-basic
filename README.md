# Donovan Laws Portfolio
This is a generic webpage written completely in HTML and CSS, prior to learning JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and other frameworks. It's purpose is to show a collection of information about me, my projects and works, and contact information.

This is my portfolio webpage I designed during the prep-course for my 5 month Software Engineering Course at Thinkful, and as I learn more about Frontend Development and using React, I would love to come back and completely redesign this page in a new React project!
